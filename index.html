    The first successful flight was massively influential in the history of aviation.
    Almost anyone you know has heard and learnt about the first successful glider that could turn and bank while flying.
    The names Orville and Wilbur Wright ring a bell and schools around the globe all teach and speak of this impactful event, the first time man could fly.
    Well, how did the Wright brothers achieve this once <em>'impossible'</em> accomplishment?
    When did humans begin starting to think about flight?
    The answer to all these thought-provoking questions is quite simple yet surprising.

  <h3>Origin of Flight</h3>
  <p>
    The discovery and popularisation of kites led series after series of historical and ground-breaking events, one such example being the mind-blowing discovery of human flight.
    However, the reason how kites came to be, was a completing different reason to what we thought it was.<br>
    <em>
      "The earliest written account of kite flying is in China in 200 BC, supporting China's claim to the origin of the kite. The Chinese General Han Hsin of the Han Dynasty flew a kite over the walls of a city he was attacking to measure how far his army would have to tunnel to reach past the defenses."
